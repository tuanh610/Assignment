Instructions
--------------------
1) Implement RoyalRumble.java
2) If you compile RoyalRumble into the same folder, you can use either run.sh or run.bat to help you run Main.main()
3) If you use an IDE, you will have to setup your own workflow to run Main.main() and pass the input file as parameter to the program.
4) Submit only RoyalRumble.java, and unit test files if you have written any.
