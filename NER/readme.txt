This assigment is not very clear on whether an NER module should be built from scratch or we can just use an 3rd party NER module and process the data in the corpus.

Since the first option is rather time consuming and there is no train data to work with, I decided to go with the 2nd option
This assignment use Spacy NER module.
To install it, on a computer that has python install, go to command line and give following command:

pip install spacy 

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
